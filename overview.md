##Overview

jMetal is an object-oriented Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics (http://jmetal.sourceforge.net).

After eight years since the first release of jMetal, we have decided it's time to make a deep redesign of the software. Some of the ideas we are elaborating are:

* Architecture redesign to provide a simpler design while keeping the same functionality.
* Promote code reusing by providing algorithm templates
* Improve code quality:
  * Application of unit testing
  * Better use of Java features (e.g, generics)
  * Design patterns (singleton, builder, factory, observer
  * Application of clean code guidelines - “Clean code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" (Robert C. Martin)
* Parallelism support
* Maven is used as the tool for development, testing, packaging and deployment.
* Introducing measures to get information of the algorithms in runtime
